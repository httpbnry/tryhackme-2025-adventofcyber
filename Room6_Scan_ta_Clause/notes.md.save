# ROOM 6 - Network Discovery - Scan-ta Clause

The context of the room is the following:

The QA environment has been breached by *HopSec*, locking access to `tbfc-devqa01` and halting the entire **SOC-mas pipeline**. The compromised server is mutating into a malicious “EAST-mas node,” and urgent action is required to restore it before takeover is complete.

Three bad bunnies are hiding on the server, each guarding a secret Easter egg. To recover the system, you must investigate the host, uncover HopSec’s access paths, and exploit exposed services and ports to regain control.

## Learning Objectives

- Use **Nmap** for network service discovery  
- Understand core **network protocols and concepts**  
- Discover hidden services and vulnerabilities  
- Regain access

---

## DISCOVERING EXPOSED SERVICES

So we know the **IP address**, so we are going to scan de IP in search of **OPEN PORTS**.

The room also tells us that we are going to need to find **3 KEYS** with the format `KEYNAME:KEY`.

so lets scan the IP with **nmap**.

> Nmap is an open-source network scanning tool used to discover hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on a network.

Im going to use the command: 

`nmap -sV -sC MACHINE_IP`

This will also run 2 nmap scripts that detect service version and the other one runs other basic scripts.
